I am currently pursuing a master's degree at the College of Computer Science, Zhejiang University (2023-present). I am affiliated with the [State Key Laboratory of CAD & CG](http://www.cad.zju.edu.cn/), where I am fortunate to be supervised by Prof. [Qiang Zou](https://qiang-zou.github.io/). Prior to this, I completed my undergraduate studies at Dalian University of Technology (2019-2023), under the guidance of Prof. [Miao Zhang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=Uu5ct6YAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate).

My research interests lie in geometric modeling, with a particular focus on GPU-accelerated geometric computations.

News
======
I will be giving a speech at the Symposium on Solid and Physical Modeling (SPM2025) at the end of October.
