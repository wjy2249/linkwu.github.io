I am currently pursuing a master's degree at the School of Computer Science, Zhejiang University (2023-present). I am affiliated with the [State Key Laboratory of CAD & CG](http://www.cad.zju.edu.cn/), where I am fortunate to be supervised by Prof. [Qiang Zou](https://qiang-zou.github.io/). Prior to this, I completed my undergraduate studies at Dalian University of Technology (2019-2023), under the guidance of Prof. [Miao Zhang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=Uu5ct6YAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate).

My research interests include but are not limited to geometric modeling, computer-aided design, parallel computing, and computer graphics. Currently, I'm working on high performance GPU B-spline modeling.

News
======
I have just been selected by Zhejiang University for this year's National Scholarship for Graduate Students, and I am deeply grateful to my advisor for his guidance and support.

At the end of October, I delivered a presentation at the Symposium on Solid and Physical Modeling (SPM2025), in which I reported on our recent research in high-performance geometric computing.
